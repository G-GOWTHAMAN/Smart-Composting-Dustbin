# Smart Composting Dustbin

The Smart Composting Dustbin is a sustainable, AI-integrated system designed to automate the conversion of biodegradable waste into mineral-rich ash, which can be used as fertilizer. This project focuses on combining clean energy, real-time monitoring, and predictive maintenance to improve urban and community-level waste management.

## Project Overview

The system is built to handle biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste through two separate chambers, promoting source-level segregation. Once the biodegradable chamber reaches 80% capacity, the waste is automatically chopped and transferred to an electrode-based combustion chamber powered by solar energy. This ensures efficient and environmentally responsible processing of organic waste.

To maintain safety and efficiency, the combustion chamber is equipped with temperature sensors and an integrated cooling system using an air blower. Activated charcoal filters are included to neutralize harmful gases and eliminate odors, ensuring clean air output.

## Key Features

- Dual chamber design for source-level waste segregation
- Electrode-based combustion system for waste processing
- Solar-powered operation to reduce dependence on conventional electricity
- Automatic waste chopping and transfer mechanism
- Temperature monitoring and controlled combustion with air blower cooling
- Activated charcoal filters for odor and gas control
- Real-time data monitoring via sensors (weight, temperature, fill level)

## AI Integration

The system uses a cloud-deployed AI model to perform predictive maintenance by analyzing sensor data in real-time. This helps detect early signs of issues such as overheating, combustion failure, or abnormal fill patterns, reducing downtime and extending the system's operational life.

## Monitoring and Control

A dedicated mobile and web application built with Flutter and Firebase provides municipal authorities with real-time access to bin status, alerts, and performance analytics. The system automatically pushes notifications when the bin is full or if an error condition is detected.

## Construction Overview

The construction includes:
- Electrode-based combustion chamber
- Dual waste segregation compartments
- Load cell for weight measurement
- Temperature sensors for combustion control
- Air blower for cooling
- Activated charcoal filter for emissions
- Microcontroller for system automation and sensor integration
- Solar panel for power supply
- Cloud connectivity for AI and remote monitoring

## Use Cases

- Streets and public areas
- Residential apartments and gated communities
- Educational institutions
- Municipal and smart city waste programs
- Rural areas with limited access to centralized waste disposal systems

## Objective

The primary objective of the Smart Composting Dustbin is to reduce landfill dependency, automate biodegradable waste disposal, and convert waste into a usable resource. By integrating AI, IoT, and renewable energy, the system promotes clean technology, enhances safety, and supports scalable waste management infrastructure.

## Status

This project is currently under development. The hardware system and core automation logic have been implemented, and AI integration along with the Flutter-based application for municipal monitoring is in progress.
