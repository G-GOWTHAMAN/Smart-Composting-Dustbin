# Smart Composting Dustbin

## Overview
-The *Smart Dustbin* is an automated system for efficient waste management that converts biodegradable waste into manure using an electrode-based combustion chamber made of stainless steel. When the biodegradable bin reaches 80% of 
 waste, the waste is automatically transferred to the combustion chamber, where it is processed into mineral-rich ash.
-The system is equipped with sensors for fill-level tracking, geolocation, and temperature monitoring. If the temperature exceeds a predefined limit, the system pauses to allow cooling before resuming operation, ensuring both safety and  
 efficiency. 
-Activated charcoal filters neutralize harmful gases and odors. The final product is mineral-rich ash, which can be processed into high-quality fertilizer. This approach promotes sustainability, reduces landfill use, and encourages 
 proper waste segregation.

## Features

### Dual-Chamber Design
- *Non-Biodegradable Waste Chamber*: For materials like plastics and metals.
- *Biodegradable Waste Chamber*: For organic waste, which is processed into fertilizer.

### Automated Waste Processing
- *Fill Level Monitoring*: Sensors (ultrasonic and weight) track the bin's capacity.
- *Automatic Transfer*: When the bin is 80% full, waste is moved to the combustion chamber.
- *Waste Chopping*: Integrated blades chop waste into smaller pieces for faster processing.

### Sustainable Combustion System
- *Electrode-Based Combustion Chamber*: Powered by solar energy, ensuring energy efficiency.
- *Temperature Monitoring*: Sensors ensure safe operation by pausing the system for cooling if the temperature exceeds a set threshold.
- *Air Blower*: Provides oxygen for combustion and cools the system as needed.

### Emission Control
- *Activated Charcoal Filters*: Neutralize harmful gases and odors, releasing clean air into the environment.

### Renewable Energy
- *Solar Panels*: Convert solar energy into electricity, making the system self-sustaining and environmentally friendly.

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Updates on fill levels, temperature, and process status are sent to municipal authorities through a web application for efficient waste collection and management.
